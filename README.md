# Realtime-chat-app

This real time chat application has been completed with usernames and connect/disconnect messages, with using Socket.io to manage real time web socket connections to a Node.js server that will allow to communicate real time chat messages to all clients connected to a single server.

The entire project takes less code of JavaScript but incredibly powerful what can be done showing receiving messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make real time application.
